          description: `The Meraki (Creative Expressions) program helps students to explore creation and expression through Art, Music, Movement and Photography. The department nurtures an inclusive environment for students, allowing for a fluid engagement with the art forms from Grade 3 onwards. Through an immersive experience in art making, creative process and reflections, Meraki aims to go beyond the product, to promote artistic process. We strongly believe that it is the process of art-making that gives a child the creative confidence, not merely the final product. Folk toy making and play, junk instruments and music making, puppetry and theatre- are some of the projects planned for junior school. <br /> <br />
The department also stands apart in its consistent efforts to integrate visual arts with other art forms and disciplines—the environment, culture, mental health, and the body. <br /> <br />

For the senior school, Meraki is offered for the students of the NIOS stream. The 11th and 12th Grade students may opt to take up an area in greater depth to create a body of work or a portfolio in art, music or photography. While this course is geared to nurture creation and free expression, some students have gone on to pursue art and music on recognising their core abilities.  <br /> <br />

Alumni of the program now find themselves in institutions such as Srishti School of Design and KM College of Music and Technology. <br /> <br />

          description: `This is a movement that was started in 2017, by working with APL students to create a garden campus that is edible. We follow regenerative agricultural practices where there is minimal cost and external inputs and maximum benefits such as harvests, a permanent ecosystem with bio diverse flora and fauna, and a closed loop system. As a part of the APL garden, our students across grades have created two Miyawaki Forests that are now self sustaining with over 20 varieties of trees, shrubs, and other vegetation. Over the years, our practices have attracted fauna such as earthworms that are indicative of a healthy soil, garden lizards that keep our insects in control, birds, butterflies, bees, and even tree frogs and toads. We have also started what we call a sky garden, where we have vines, both ornamental and edible growing on the topmost floor edges of our building that also double up as natural cool curtains for our classrooms there. The main aim of the Eat Your School Garden movement is to impart Education for Sustainability (EfS) and share our best practices with other schools to encourage more schools to create such learning gardens. We are also active on social media with Eat Your School Garden pages on Facebook and Instagram, along with a blog page with student contributions on medium.com. <br/> <br/>

Participation in national and international competitions like the MUN, inter-school cultural events, and talent competitions across various interest areas helps build self-confidence and offers opportunities for students to broaden their horizons.
Students hone their leadership abilities as they manage all major school events, participate in the school student council, and volunteer to conduct events.

    Dance, being an art of expressing one’s emotion through graceful movements without words, helps in coordinating brain and body senses making it a universally spoken tongue.



    The main objective of this club is to allow the students to experience the beauty of this art form and understand its cultural relevance.


  
    The club organises sessions working on flexibility and strength through movements. Not only does this help the students to tap into their hidden talent but also develop a sense of rhythm.
  


    It serves as an opportunity for the students to learn about body posture, aiding as a fitness regimen and as a stress buster.
  

  
    Powered by professional dance artists, this club also serves to boost their self-esteem, cognizance of the aesthetic and a way of recreation.

        "Meraki (Creative Expressions)":`The Meraki (Creative Expressions) program helps students to explore creation and expression through Art, Music, Movement and Photography. The department nurtures an inclusive environment for students, allowing for a fluid engagement with the art forms from Grade 3 onwards. Through an immersive experience in art making, creative process and reflections, Meraki aims to go beyond the product, to promote artistic process. We strongly believe that it is the process of art-making that gives a child the creative confidence, not merely the final product. Folk toy making and play, junk instruments and music making, puppetry and theatre- are some of the projects planned for junior school.
The department also stands apart in its consistent efforts to integrate visual arts with other art forms and disciplines—the environment, culture, mental health, and the body.

For the senior school, Meraki is offered for the students of the NIOS stream. The 11th and 12th Grade students may opt to take up an area in greater depth to create a body of work or a portfolio in art, music or photography. While this course is geared to nurture creation and free expression, some students have gone on to pursue art and music on recognising their core abilities. 

Alumni of the program now find themselves in institutions such as Srishti School of Design and KM College of Music and Technology.

"MUSIC" : `Even before recorded history, people created music, whether through drumming, singing or chanting. Some of our strongest emotions may be brought on by listening to a piece of music.
To enable our students to understand and learn this method of expression, we introduced Music as a subject from Grade 1 to 8. At APL Global, using various Western Classical Music teaching techniques (like Alfred’s, John Thomson, Suzuki and Trinity based) we equip our students to play and analyse all levels of music.
Since we believe each child is unique, we ensure that equal importance is given to both World Music and Indian Classical Music in the curriculum, so that students are exposed to alternative forms of music. In addition, we ensure that students are exposed to top-notch music and sound engineering software so that they are in touch with aspects of music production as well.

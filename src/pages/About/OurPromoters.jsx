                APL Global School’s Personalized Learning Design is an extension
                of the same ethos of customization into the field of education.
                The architects for this project, Arvind Varuna Associates have
                converted these values with equal passion and have gone out of
                their way to accommodate our customisation requests.

                The infrastructure has been designed to cater to the varied
                needs of the students with the sports facilities, spacious
                auditorium and a multi purpose gallery being some of its
                hallmarks.

                To provide a shield from the marshland, a 30 feet grill wall has
                been erected at the western side of the building which supports
                a vertical garden, simulating a rainforest environment.

                Natural Stones like Tandur stone are used for the flooring to
                provide an anti-skid, low maintenance but hardy surface. The
                exterior Wall paint is made from grinding natural stones like
                green marble and Jaisalmer stone to provide an earthy, chemical
                free wall finish with an elegant look; a unique Ramaniyam
                innovation.

                Founder Gita Jagannathan says - “Academy for Personalized
                Learning is based on the principles of person-centered approach
                to Education, Inclusion and Sustainable Living. The school
                nurtures and supports every individual to be a happy and healthy
                person who confidently explores the limits of their own
                potential. APL Global School believes that schools should
                provide a safe and open space, in which children build an
                understanding of self, their community and the larger world
                while exploring their role in society.”
